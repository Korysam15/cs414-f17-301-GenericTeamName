#################### Changes to *p4.client_server #########################

	Updated package structor to reflect p4 rather than p3.
	==================== Changes to *.client ==========================
		1. AbstractClient.java:
			1.1. Updated package structor for p4
				(aka renamed p3 to p4)
		
		2. Client.java:
			2.1. Added a nested class to represent the thread 
				that receives messages from the server
			
			2.2. Added a nested class that sends EntryTask's or
				ExitTask's to server.  This class assists 
				in a wait / notfiy mechanisms for crucial
				tasks that change the state of the client.
			
			2.3. Refactored long methods by breaking them
				down into smaller ones. 

	============ END Changes to *.client ==============================


	============ Changes to *.server ==================================
		1. events.*
			1.1. Implemented SendEvent.java, this class allows 
				the Server to distribute the sending of 
				Tasks among the threadPool.
		
		2. registry.*
			2.1. AbstractRegistry.java:
				2.1.1. Added more abstract methods.

				2.1.2. Refactored by adding comments.

			2.2. FileRegistry.java:

					added to AbstractRegistry.
			2.3. User.java:

 					session was logged in (registered)
					with the server.

				3.1.2. Improved response messages for
					LoginTask's and RegisterTask's.

				3.1.3. Refactored long methods by breaking
					them down into smaller ones.

		4. Added game_server.*
			This package is designed specifically for our
 			banqi game.
			
			It manages games and their state, validates moves
			players make (send to the server). 

			Manages and validates InviteTasks, 		
			AcceptInviteTasks, RejectInviteTask, 		
			as well as CreateGameTasks.
 
			4.1. Added AbstractGameServer.java:
				4.1.1. Implements methods that are
					abstracted away from extending 
					classes. 

				4.1.2. Declares abstract methods that 
				extending classes should implement for the 
				handling of specific GameTask's.

			4.2. Added GameServer.java:
				4.2.1. Implements abstract methods
					inherited from
					AbstractGameServer.java

				4.2.2. Improves response's from the 
					"Server" when a GameTask is 
					invalid.

				4.2.3. Checks if the other player in the
					game is online, and only if they
					are online, will the tasks be
					forwarded to them.
					TODO: Otherwise the game state is
					changed, and when the "other
					player" is logs in they should
					receive the updated "GameState".

				4.2.4. Will act as an observer (maybe idk)
					in a grasp pattern.

				4.2.5. Functions, but is incomplete.

			4.3. Added GameManager.java:
				4.3.1. Needs implementation, but will be
					responsible for managing/saving
					games. As well as validating turns.

				4.3.2. Will act as a controller 
					in a grasp pattern.

			4.4. Added GameInviteManager.java:
				4.4.1. Manages invites sent to and from
					users.

				4.4.2. As of now, if a player invites
					another player (without them
					accepting/rejecting the first
					invitation) the invitation will
					be overwritten.

				4.4.3. Will act as a controller
					in a grasp pattern.

				4.4.4. Needs to integrate with a DB/File
					to actually save the invitation.
	
		5. Changes to AbstractServer.java:
			5.1. Added more comments.

			5.2. Added more abstract methods.

			5.3. Added @Deprecated to methods that may be 
				insecure.  The only reason they were kept
				is for backwards compatibility :)
		
		6. Changes to Server.java:
			6.1. Security Enhancements:
				6.1.1. Checks that ForwardTasks / 
					MultiForwardTasks playerFrom
					(nicknames) are not spoofed.

				6.1.2. Checks that ForwardTasks do not 
					contain EntryTasks/EntryResponses
					that could crash a player.

				6.1.3. Checks that ForwardTasks do not 
					contain ExitTasks/ExitResponses
					that could crash a player.

			6.2. Implemented the added abstract methods 
				inherited from AbstractServer.java.


			6.3. Added use of SendEvent to distribute the
				sending of tasks among the thread pool.

			6.4. Refactored long methods by breaking them down
				into several smaller ones.

			6.5. Reflected the @Deprecated changes in
				AbstractServer.java
	============ END Changes to *.server ==============================

	============ Changes to *.transmission ============================
		1. Broke Task's down to separate packages.
			1.1. Added transimission.game.*:
				1.1.1. Added GameTask.java, 
					which improves 
					inheritance/abstraction.  
					Declares a few abstract methods
 					that all GameTask's should have.

				1.1.2. Made the following classes extend
 					GameTask rather than Task.java:
						CreateGameTask.java
						FlipPieceTask.java
						ForfeitTask.java
						MoveTask.java
						UpdateRecordTask.java

				1.1.3. Added InvalidGameTask.java:
					represents an error message from
					an AbstractGameServer. This class
					is used to notify players when
					they submitted an incorrect 
					GameTask.

			1.2. Added transimission.game.invite.*
				1.2.1. Added InviteGameTask.java:
					This class is an abstract class
					that extends GameTask.java. This 
					class introduces a higher level of
					abstraction that separates other
					GameTask's from Tasks related to 
					invitations.

				1.2.2. Made the following classes extend
					InviteGameTask.java rather than
						Task.java:
						InviteTask.java
						AcceptInviteTask.java
						RejectInviteTask.java

			1.3. Added transmission.profile.*
				1.3.1. Moved DisplayProfileTask.java
					from transmission to 
					transmission.profile.

				1.3.2. Moved GetProfileTask.java
					from transmission to 
					transmission.profile.
			
			1.4. Added transmission.registration_login.*
				1.4.1. Added EntryTask.java:
					This class is an abstract class
					that extends Task.java. This 
					class introduces a higher level of
					abstraction that separates other
					Task's from Tasks related to 
					logging in or registering with the
					server.

				1.4.2. Made the following Tasks extend
					EntryTask.java rather than 
					Task.java:
						LoginTask.java
						RegisterTask.java

				1.4.3. Added ExitTask.java:
					This class is an abstract class
					that extends Task.java. This 
					class introduces a higher level of
					abstraction that separates other
					Task's from Tasks related to 
					logging off or unregistering with
					the server.

				1.4.4. Made the following Tasks extend
					ExitTask.java rather than 
					Task.java:
						LogoutTask.java
						UnregisterTask.java

			1.5. Added transission.registration_login.response
				1.5.1. Added EntryResponseTask.java:
					This class is an abstract class
					that extends Task.java. This 
					class introduces a higher level of
					abstraction that separates other
					Task's from Tasks (sent from the 
					server)	 related to the status of
					logging in or registering with the
					server.

				1.5.2. Made the following Tasks extend
					EntryResponseTask.java rather than 
					Task.java:
						LoginGreetingTask.java
						RegisterGreetingTask.java
						LoginErrorTask.java
						RegistrationErrorTask.java

				1.5.3. Added ExitResponseTask.java
					This class is responsible for 
					login off a client after the 
					server receives a LogoutTask or
					UnregisterTask.
			
				1.5.4. Added ServerDisconnectedTask.java:
					Extends ExitResponseTask.java.
					This class is responsible for 
					notifying users that the server
					has closed the connection to the
					client.

			1.6. Added transmission.util
				1.6.1. Added UtilityTask.java:
					This class is an abstract class
					that extends Task.java. This 
					class introduces a higher level of
					abstraction that separates other
					Task's from more common 
					non-specific Tasks.

				1.6.2. Made the following Tasks extend
					UtilityTask.java rather than
					Task.java:
						ForwardTask.java
						MultiForwardTask.java
						MessageTask.java
				
		2. Changes to Task.java:
			2.1. Made toByteArray() non-abstract.

			2.2. Added abstract method writeBytes.
				This simplifies and significantly reduces,
				the amount of code extensions of Task.java
				have to implement.

		3. Changes to all *Task.java
			3.1. Removed all toByteArray() methods from 
				classes that extend Task.java.

			3.2. Implemented writeBytes() on all non-abstract
				Tasks.
